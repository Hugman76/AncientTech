# ðŸŒ  Sunset Starter
Sunset Starter generates a functioning starter mod using the Dawn API.

This may only be used by the founder of the Dawn Team, Hugman. However, other members may also be able to use it if needed.
If you are not part of the Dawn Team organisation, it does not make sense to use this **yet**, as everything is **currently** set up to reference the Dawn Team, link Hugman's Patreon, etc..

## ðŸ›  Usage

Creating the basics of a mod has never been easier.
1. As with every Dawn Team's mod, it is recommended to claim ownership of a CurseForge and a Modrinth project before continuing. 
2. Create a repository with the ["Use this template"](https://github.com/DawnTeamMC/SunsetStarter/generate) button.
3. Run the Python script `setup.py` to generate the files.
4. Follow the instructions that the script gives you.
5. Happy modding!
